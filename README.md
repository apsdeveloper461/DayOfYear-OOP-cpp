## Problem Statment and Its Solution

# Assuming that a year has 365 days, write a class named DayOfYear that takes an integer representing a day of the year and translates it to a string consisting of the month
followed by day of the month. For example,
## Day 2 would be January 2.
## Day 32 would be February 1.
## Day 365 would be December 31.

# The constructor for the class should take as parameter an integer representing the day of the year, and the class should have a member function print() that prints the day in the month–day format. The class should have an integer member variable to represent the day, and should have static member variables holding strings that can be used to assist in the translation from the integer format to the month-day format. Test your class by inputting various integers representing days and printing out their representation in the month–day format.
